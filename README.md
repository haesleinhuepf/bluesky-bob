# bluesky-bob

This repository contains code that responds to messages on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/) using large language models via [Github Models Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) and the [atproto API](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto). 
It will only respond to messages from accounts that it follows.
You can see it in action [here](https://bsky.app/profile/haesleinhuepf-bot.bsky.social).

This is an academic research project and not intended to be used in production.
